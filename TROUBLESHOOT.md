# Netlify 404 Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: 404 Error on Netlify

### Step-by-Step Solutions:

## Solution 1: GitHub + Netlify (Most Reliable)

1. **Create GitHub Repository:**
   ```bash
   # You already have git initialized
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sensor-dashboard.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

2. **Deploy on Netlify:**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub
   - Select your repository
   - **Build settings:**
     - Build command: (leave empty)
     - Publish directory: `.`
   - Click "Deploy site"

## Solution 2: Test with Simple File

1. **Upload `simple.html` first** to test if Netlify works at all
2. **Visit:** `https://your-site.netlify.app/simple.html`
3. If this works, then try the main dashboard

## Solution 3: Manual Upload (Alternative)

1. **Go to Netlify dashboard**
2. **Click "New site from Git"**
3. **Choose "Deploy manually"**
4. **Upload the entire folder** (not just index.html)
5. **Deploy**

## Solution 4: Check File Structure

Make sure your files are structured like this:
```
your-project/
├── index.html
├── simple.html
├── DEPLOY.md
└── TROUBLESHOOT.md
```

## Solution 5: Alternative Domain

If the main domain doesn't work, try:
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/index.html`
- `https://your-site.netlify.app/simple.html`

## 🔍 Debug Steps:

### 1. Check Netlify Logs
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click on your site
- Go to "Deploys" tab
- Check for any build errors

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Check File Permissions
```bash
ls -la index.html
# Should show: -rw-r--r--
```

### 4. Validate HTML
- Open index.html in a browser locally
- Check for any JavaScript errors in console (F12)

## 🆘 If Nothing Works:

### Option A: Use a Different Platform
- **Vercel**: Similar to Netlify, often more reliable
- **GitHub Pages**: Free static hosting
- **Surge.sh**: Simple static hosting

### Option B: Create a New Netlify Account
- Sometimes account-specific issues occur
- Try with a different email/account

### Option C: Contact Netlify Support
- If you have a paid plan
- Include your site URL and error details

## 📞 Quick Test Commands:

```bash
# Test local server
curl -I http://localhost:8000/

# Check file exists
ls -la index.html

# Validate HTML structure
head -10 index.html
```

## 🎯 Expected Result:

After successful deployment, you should see:
- Your beautiful sensor dashboard
- API configuration section at the top
- Charts loading (or error messages if API is not connected)

## 🔧 Next Steps After Success:

1. **Update API URL** in the dashboard configuration
2. **Test with your Flask backend**
3. **Share the URL** with others
